# Concert-Connect
Concert Connect provides a way to connect with other UNC Charlotte students going to concerts. You can select a genre of music from the available categories and then pick an artist that you are most interested in. From there you can learn more about the specific event and add it to your saved concerts. You can update or delete any events you previously registered for.

The purpose of this web application is to connect UNC Charlotte students going to the same concert. The target market is currently UNC Charlotte students, but with a few additions, it could be utilized by all college students.
